This is my first Python Django project written from scratch.

The following techologies have been used:
- PostgreSQL for database
- pipenv for dependency management
- bootstrap for HTML structure and styling
- mapbox API for viewing map with my hometown
- recaptcha v2 validation

Github is used here excusively for storing code, database required to run it properly is stored locally.

Sample screenshots of page may be found in sample folder
